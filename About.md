# About MagicToDoList

The **MagicToDoList** was created by **Gareth Davies**, founder of the **Bestem Network**, as a practical tool for managing day-to-day project actions.

During years of running project management offices (PMOs) across multiple clients and initiatives, Gareth needed a simple way to keep track of who was doing what, and by when — especially when working part-time or across several engagements. The MagicToDoList evolved from those needs.

By using a structured approach — one sheet per workstream — and integrating reporting macros, the tool allows users to generate concise summaries by date, person, importance, or status. The result is a lightweight but powerful task tracker that works entirely within Excel.
