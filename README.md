## Overview

The **MagicToDoList** is a macro-enabled Excel workbook designed to help individuals and small teams manage tasks across multiple workstreams. Originally created while running project management offices (PMOs) for various clients, it has been refined through years of practical use to track actions, responsibilities, and deadlines effectively.

Each workstream has its own sheet where you can add people, tasks, dates, importance levels, and statuses. Built-in macros then generate filtered reports by:
- **Date**
- **Person**
- **Workstream**
- **Importance**
- **Status**

The MagicToDoList is ideal for independent consultants, small business owners, and anyone juggling multiple commitments across different clients or projects.
